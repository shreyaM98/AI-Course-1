# Heavy Queens Problem 
( Part of AI coursework  )
 
The heavy queens' problem is a modified N-Queens problem where each queen is associated with position coordinates and a weight. The rules are similar to those of N-Queens, where no two queens should be on the same diagonal or the same row (horizontal). In addition to the number of tiles moved, the cost function considers the weight of the queen.
